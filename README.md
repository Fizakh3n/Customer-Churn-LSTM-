🚀 Predicting Customer Churn using LSTM: A Data-Driven Approach! 🚀<br>

•Customer churn is a key challenge for businesses today. Using data science and machine learning, we can predict churn and retain valuable customer<br>
 
🔎 Objective: To predict whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay based on behavioral data such as tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges.<br>

📊 Steps Involved:<br>
•Data Collection: We utilized the popular Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides key features like customer tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and more.<br>

•Data Preprocessing:<br>
•Converted non-numeric columns into numeric types (e.g., MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges).<br>
•Handled missing values and ensured all features were in the right format for the model.<br>
•Selected only three relevant features: tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges.<br>
•Feature Scaling: Scaled numeric data using techniques like StandardScaler to normalize the values, ensuring the model treats all features equally.<br>
<br>
•LSTM Model Setup:<br>
•LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), excels at handling sequential data and recognizing patterns over time.<br>
Even though we didn’t have time series data here, LSTM still helps with complex feature interactions that can arise in churn prediction.<br>

👉 How it works: LSTM maintains a "memory" over long sequences, which helps the model better understand patterns like customer behavior over time.<br>

•Model Training:<br>
We trained the model using tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges as inputs.<br>

•LSTM uses backpropagation through time (BPTT) to adjust its parameters for better performance over time.<br>

•Model Evaluation: After training, we evaluated the model's accuracy using the test set to ensure it can generalize well to unseen data. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall helped gauge its performance.<br>

•Testing Predictions:<br>
Used real-world test inputs like tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges to predict churn.<br>

☁️For example, a customer with low tenure and high monthly charges is more likely to churn, while a long-term customer with moderate charges is less likely.<br>

🔮 LSTM's Strength: LSTM's ability to capture dependencies over "time" makes it a strong contender in predictive tasks, even when dealing with non-sequential data!<br>

🎯 Impact: With this model, businesses can:<br>
•Identify high-risk customers before they churn.<br>
•Implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates.<br>

•Ultimately, improve customer loyalty and reduce marketing costs.<br>
